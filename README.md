## About The Project

This is a simple timber mod with fast leaf decay. Durability removed for each log broken (Unbreaking enchant taken into account 20%/27%/30% for no durability loss). Logs are broken in sequence one at a time with a little magical sound. Leaf decay still drops regular drops. Timber will not work if you have less durability than logs to break.
